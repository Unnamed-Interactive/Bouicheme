# Bouichême
A remake of an Autoscroller game that had been made in 6 hours!

## How to build
**⚠️ NOTE :** Please wait for official builds on [itch](https://itch.io) to post reviews. This repo is only made to make the source code available.
However, if you would like to play the game early, you need to:

1. Get a binary of [Godot **4**](https://godotengine.org/download) (⚠️ It has to be Godot 4 ___NON-MONO___, as builds might fail on certain platforms with mono) 
2. Clone this repo
3. Import ``./project.godot`` from godot project selector
4. Hit `F5` for a simple game, or go to Project > Export to make executables for any available platform.
